# React-Leaflet Map Application:

is a dynamic, interactive mapping solution developed using React and the react-leaflet library. This application is designed for users to easily interact with various geographical markers, and it supports features such as marker clustering and dynamic data loading based on the viewport. It's ideal for projects that require a visually appealing, interactive map with custom markers and efficient data management.

## Live Demo

You can see the React-Leaflet Map Application in action at visit [react-leaflet-ikram.surge.sh]("https://react-leaflet-ikram.surge.sh")

## Usage

To integrate the `React-Leaflet` Map Application in your project, follow these steps:

```
import { MapContainer, TileLayer } from "react-leaflet";
import "leaflet/dist/leaflet.css";
import Controller from "./Controller";

const config = {
center: [47.316666, 5.016667],
zoom: 6,
};

const App = () => {
return (
<MapContainer
      center={config.center}
      zoom={config.zoom}
      scrollWheelZoom={false}
      className="map"
      maxZoom={17}
      minZoom={3}
    >
<TileLayer
        attribution='&copy; <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright">OpenStreetMap</a> contributors'
        url="https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png"
      />
<Controller />
</MapContainer>
);
};
```

## Feature Descriptions

- Dynamic Marker Clustering: Utilizes useSupercluster for efficiently managing and displaying a large number of markers.
  Customizable Markers: Customize markers with leaflet Icons and DivIcons.
- Dynamic Data Loading: Loads and displays data based on the map's current bounds, optimizing performance.
- Interactive Map Controls: Easy to navigate with zoom and pan controls.
  Responsive Popups: Clickable markers that display additional information in popups.
  Configuration

Set up the application with these configurations:

- Map Center and Zoom Level: Configurable in the config object.

- react-leaflet: For rendering and managing the map.
- leaflet: For map features and custom markers.
- useSupercluster: For clustering markers.

## Limitations and Considerations

The map is set to a specific region by default. Modify the config object for different locations.
External API dependency may have rate limits or data update constraints.
